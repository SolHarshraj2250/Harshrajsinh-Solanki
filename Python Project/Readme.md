# 1.) Project Description:-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project Title:- Multiple Type of Vehicle Counting and Vehicle Detection From Video
## Description:-
Currently We all know Traffic and Road Maintaince is one of the biggest issue across all over the World. So overcome that Problem We have tried to implement this Project. In this Project, I had used Python as my base lanquage and I had used Pytorch and Pyqt5 kind of Apis and other useful Apis to complete this project with best of my Effort.
Also We have taken the help of the yolov3 and sort algorithm for object detection to implement this project.
# APIS Information (Which New API We have Used?):-
- Opencv (For Reading a Video and to Manipulate it)
- PYQT5 (For GUI Purpose)
- Pytorch (To Perform Tensor Computing For Multidimensional Array (Tensor))
- For Which Purpose We have use this apis brief Information is given in the seperate pdf file for that just click on the below link:-

# 2.) Project Running:-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Requirements:-
- Windows/Linux
- Anaconda3 Navigator

## Please Follow these Steps For Runnning this Project:-
1. Install Pytorch and PyQt5 in your Anaconda Navigator From Anaconda Prompt (Not by Usual Command Prompt) through Below Commands:-
- conda install -c pytorch pytorch (For Pytorch)
- conda install -c anaconda pyqt or conda install -c dsdale24 pyqt5
2. This yolov3 file is big. So i have posted link overhere So before moving further step you need to download this in your pc and you have to paste it into "Algo" Folder which i have Submitted Empty for that.
The Link is:-[link_(Dataset)](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
3. After that please run this project's main file through "Anaconda Command Prompt" by giving path of that specific file. And then write:- python Main.py
4. After that GUI will open and First You need to Select the video From "input-Output" File (Which i have puted overhere) and then Select the appropriate Area by clicking double click on mouse and then Start the video then You will be able to see the Proper Live Running of Project.
5. After that Final Result will be stored in final.txt in Final directory with Proper Format.
Like the Format is:- [Videoname, Count, Objectname] for each Vehicle. For Example:- Input1 1 bicycle etc.

# 4.) Benefits of this Project to the Real World:-
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- As We Know in Real World there are lots of Problem is going on. One of them is Traffic and Road Maintainance (Especially in India). Everybody is Suffering through this problem.So From this Project we can Count the Number of Different type of Vehicles running onto the Road. So we need Some Automation System For that because through Human the task will become tedious. So Through this System We can Predict after how much time this Road should be Maintained and We can also Predict that at Which time Traffic will be more or less For that Just We need the CCTV Video From Government for this.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 5.) Challenges:- (Means We can Extend this Project to Higher Scale Based On Real World need)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Detection Of NumberPlate of Objects
- Face Detection of Person Who is Inside the Objects
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
